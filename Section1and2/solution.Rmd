This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
myString <- "Hello World!!!"

print(myString)

mean_value <- mean(1.50)

mean_value
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Complete the following tasks using the NIPostcodes dataset described above.

a) Show the total number of rows, the structure of the data frame, and first 10 rows of the data frame containing all of the NIPostcode data.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

b) Add a suitable title for each attribute of the data.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

c) Replace and recode all missing entries with a suitable identifier. Decide whether it is best to remove none, some or all of the missing data. Discuss the missing data using suitable graphical output to explain your answer and justify your decision in detail.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

d) Show the total number of missing values for each column in the postcode data frame both before and after your decision to deal with the missing data variables.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

e) Move the primary key identifier to the start of the dataset.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

f) Create a new dataset called Limavady_data. Store within it only information where locality, townland and town contain the name Limavady. Count and display the number of rows. Store this information in a csv file called Limavady.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

g) Save the modified NIPostcode dataset in a csv file called CleanNIPostcodeData.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```
